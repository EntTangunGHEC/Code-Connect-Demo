# Code Connect Demo

Barebones React demo of Figma's [Code Connect](https://github.com/figma/code-connect).

## Codebase setup

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run app:dev` will run server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) which renders contents of [App.tsx](src/App.tsx).

## Figma file and Code Connect prep
